# ML Project Structure

This repository contains a structured machine learning project, encompassing data ingestion, transformation, model training, and prediction pipelines. It serves as a comprehensive framework for building and deploying machine learning models.

```

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Data Ingestion

The data ingestion process reads data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing datasets, and saves them to the `artifacts` directory.

```python
from src.components.data_ingestion import DataIngestion

data_ingestion = DataIngestion()
train_data_path, test_data_path = data_ingestion.initiate_data_ingestion()
```

### Data Transformation

The data transformation process preprocesses the data for model training.

```python
from src.components.data_transformation import DataTransformation

data_transformation = DataTransformation()
train_arr, test_arr, _ = data_transformation.initiate_preprocessor(train_data_path, test_data_path)
```

### Model Training

The model training process trains a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.

```python
from src.components.model_trainer import ModelTrainer

model_trainer = ModelTrainer()
result_score = model_trainer.initiate_model(train_arr, test_arr)
print(result_score)
```

### Prediction

The prediction pipeline uses the trained model to make predictions on new data.

```python
import pandas as pd
from src.pipeline.predict_pipeline import PredictPipeline

data = pd.read_csv('path/to/new/data.csv')
predict_pipeline = PredictPipeline()
predictions = predict_pipeline.predict(data)
print(predictions)
```

### Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` directory with timestamps to help track the project's progress and performance.
